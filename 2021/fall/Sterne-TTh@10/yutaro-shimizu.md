## Hello

I'm Yutaro, an **M23** sudent single majoring in *Natural Sciences College*. My specialty is 
> forest ecology
> climate science

and I currently reside in Nagano, Japan to study the effect of global warming on `<beech trees>`. I hope to use next summer to get a *computational biology* experience, in the field of `<statistics or Deep Learning>`, thus have spent parts of my passtime practice coding on my own. I'm very **excited** to see what we will achieve in this course!

Kalyeane thinks I should add a list. I want to make her happy so here it is:
- Here's I like Trains
