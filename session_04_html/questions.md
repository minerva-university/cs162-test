# Web Assignment – Questions to Bring

1) For a multi‑column layout made only with HTML, what are best practices for semantic grouping (e.g., when to use `<section>`/`<article>` instead of `<div>`)?
2) When building large pages, how do we keep `<div>` nesting readable and avoid "div‑soup"? Any naming conventions you suggest?
3) On the debugging side, what are your go‑to checks in DevTools when an element does not appear (z‑index, overflow, position, specificity)?
