# DevTools Exercise – Notes Template

Pick ONE site:
- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
- https://www.bbc.com/news

## 1) High‑level structure you observed
- Top bar / header wrapper: `<header>` or `<div id="...">` wrapping the logo + nav.
- Main content wrapper: a large `<div>` or `<main>` that holds the page sections.
- Grid/section containers: repeated `<div>`s that group blocks of content.
- Footer wrapper.

## 2) Example of `<div>` nesting you found
Paste a short snippet (copy from Elements panel) and annotate what each wrapper groups.

## 3) Why this structure works
- It groups related blocks for layout (grids/columns).
- It separates concerns (header vs content vs footer).
- It makes it easier to move or restyle whole sections.

## 4) Things you noticed in DevTools
- Which CSS rules applied / were overridden.
- Box model hints (margins, padding) that explained spacing.
- ARIA roles or landmarks you saw (if any).
