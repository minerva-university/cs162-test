# CS162 – Session 04: HTML Pre‑Class Work

This folder contains a Kanban HTML page and notes templates for the pre‑class tasks.

## Files
- `kanban.html` – a standalone HTML file that meets the assignment spec: title, logout, 5 columns, example tasks, footer.
- `devtools_notes.md` – a template to jot down what you find while inspecting a modern site with Chrome DevTools.
- `questions.md` – a small list of questions to bring to class about the Web assignment.

## How to open
1. Double‑click `kanban.html` to open in Chrome.
2. Take a screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4 on macOS, Win+Shift+S on Windows) for your submission / in‑class paste.
3. Open DevTools (Right‑click → Inspect) and explore how `<div>`s structure the page.
