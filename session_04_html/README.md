## An HTML Primer

The next few sessions will focus on web technologies.

The following (freely-available) short course uses active learning to help you
understand HTML:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML

It consists of the following guides:

1. Getting started with HTML
2. Metadata in HTML
3. HTML text fundamentals
4. Creating hyperlinks
5. Advanced text formatting
6. Document and website structure
7. Debugging HTML

Work through the guides at your own pace. If you are comfortable with the
material then you can skip any sections as you see fit.

(Optional) If you want to mainly work on the frontend design for the final project, then it is recommended
that you also work through the following guide:
[HTML and CSS Crash Course Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G)
This contains a lot more information about laying things out correctly with CSS.

## Questions

### 1. Examine a modern webpage in Chrome dev tools

After watching the video on Chrome dev tools, open one of the follow sites in Chrome and use the dev tools to inspect the HTML.
Pay particular attention to how &lt;div&gt;s are used to lay out the page. Do not pay attention to the CSS.

Site:

- https://forum.minerva.edu/
- https://www.bbc.com/news
- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

Come to class ready to sketch out how divs might structure a page, and why it works that way.

### 2. Kanban board

Start a simple design for the Kanban board. It should include

- the Title of the site
- an option to logout
- the 5 columns of the board
- Some example tasks in each column
- a footer

CSS is something that is not a part of this course, so use tooling to help you with the design. For example, you can use [this tool](https://www.figma.com/) to create a design and then export the CSS. Alternatively you can give the html to a chatbot, and ask for some CSS that will appropriately format the page. Once you have finalized your design, please take a screenshot of the website, and come to class with this screenshot ready to be pasted into a document.

### 3. Web assignment

Please read the [web assignment](../assignments/web_application.md) and come to class with any
questions that you have.

**Please commit your work to your PCW repo and push it to github before class!**
