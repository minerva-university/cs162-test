# *Hello*

## My name is Libby

I am a computer science student at Minerva University. My home state is **Maine** in the US. 

Some of my favorite things include:
- My cat Tin Tin
- Dancing
- Ravioli

A quote I like is: 

> Taking naps sounds so childish. I prefer to call them horizontal life pauses.
