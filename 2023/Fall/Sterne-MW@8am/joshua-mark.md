Hello, I'm Joshua Mark.

- Born in Abuja, Nigeria
- Moved to Uyo, Nigeria
- Got into Minerva in 2021
- Currently in Buenos Aires


I like markdown, because I can format two things I like: `code` and $math$. *Math?* You ask. Yes. A simple formula I like to use to preview math on a markdown/latex renderer is
$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

The well known <u>quadratic formula</u>. The last two words should have been underlined, though this may not work on some renderers.

And for code, let's write a one-line $O(n)$ time fibonacci function in Python.

```python
fib = lambda n: (lambda n, l: ( [l.__setitem__(i,(l[i-2] + l[i-1])) for i in range(2, n)]))(n, l:=[0,1]+[0]*(n-2)) and l

print(fib(10)) # [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

This uses the **walrus** operator, so is only valid from Python3.8.

## What else about me?
When I'm not reading topology, watching youtube videos on the Langlands program and learning Haskell, I'm watching anime, listening to music or doing Minerva things.
