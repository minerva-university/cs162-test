## I Guess this is who I am 

I am ***kyron nyoro***. 22 years of age(feeling kinda old to be honest).
A computer science major who loves  playing guitar. I have played guitar for about a decade now and well after a decade I can almost play anything that I can hear(however don't bring me any heavy jazz progressions). 

well since this is a biography I guess I will let my social media feed to speak about my interest since at this point instagram and youtube probably know me more than I know myself. 

### Instagram: <br>
 * Motivational study videos since God knows I need to stop procrastinating my CS 162 assignment due on the 13th of this month. 
 * Soccer reels  since we have to know what crazy things Messi is doing nowadays 
 * Cooking videos (best way to prep breast -- I really need to start meal prepping
 * Local new(well clout but that is considered news nowadays apparently. 
 * programming concepts / Jokes 

### Youtube: <br>
- Formula 1 
- Comedy shorts 
- Podcast Banter 

### Mantra:
  > "If the money cannot solve the problem, eat the money "
