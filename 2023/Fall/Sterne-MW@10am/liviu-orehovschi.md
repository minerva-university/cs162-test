Hey there, I'm **Liviu**, and I come from **Moldova**, a place close to my heart with strong ties to both **Romanian** and **Ukrainian** cultures.

My love for travel didn't start at Minerva â€“ it's been a part of me for as long as I can remember. Exploring new destinations and experiencing different cultures has always been a source of inspiration and growth for me.

Currently, I'm pursuing a major in **Computer Science and Natural Science** at Minerva. It's a journey that allows me to blend my tech-savvy side with my deep appreciation for the arts. (Yes, you heard right)

Whether I'm diving into the world of coding or immersing myself in the creative realm, I'm all about embracing the diverse opportunities that Minerva has to offer. Join me as I continue this exciting adventure of learning and discovery!
