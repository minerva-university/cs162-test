## 👋 Hello There

Hi! I’m **Boss Huang**, a student, builder, and occasional overthinker who lives at the intersection of **business**, **technology**, and **community impact**.

I’ve spent my life asking questions like:

* *Why does this system work the way it does?*
* *Who does it leave out?*
* *Can we redesign it… but better?*
