## About Me

- **Scholar** of the digital arts 🧙
- **Adventurer** in algorithmic forests
- **Caffeine enthusiast** with a keyboard
- ***Hopelessly optimistic*** about code compiling on the first try

## My Powers

1. *Debugging* with the fury of a thousand suns
2. **Crafting** elegant solutions from chaos
3. ***Occasionally*** remembering to comment my code
4. Finding that one missing semicolon at 3 AM

> "To code or not to code? That is not the question—*the question is whether it will compile.*"
