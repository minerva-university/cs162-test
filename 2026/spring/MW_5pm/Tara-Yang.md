## About Me

Hi, I’m Tara
I’m a CS162 student who enjoys exploring both **external adventures** and **internal landscapes**.

I like building systems, but I’m just as curious about the systems *inside* people —
how we think, feel, reflect, and change over time.

## Things I Genuinely Enjoy

* 🏂 **Snowboarding & skiing** — single board, double board, I love them both
* 🪂 **Skydiving** — trusting systems, physics, and myself
* 🧠 **Psychology** — especially self-awareness, emotions, and motivation

---

## What I’m Curious About Lately

* How tools shape human behavior and self-perception
* How technology can support **reflection instead of distraction**
* How people make sense of uncertainty — in life and in code

---

## Projects I Want to Build

I’m interested in creating projects related to:

* Self-awareness and reflection
* Emotional tracking and sense-making
* Gentle tools that help people notice patterns rather than “optimize” themselves

In other words:
software that feels more like a **mirror** than a **dashboard**.
