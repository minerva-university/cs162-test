# Ahmed Bakr: From Nuclear Dreams to AI Realities

## The Origin Story (Or: How YouTube Failures Lead to Startup Wins)

> *"I thought I was creating art. YouTube thought I was creating lawsuits."* - 13-year-old me

### The Journey in Numbers

- **1** crashed YouTube channel (RIP 2015)
- **70,000+** followers on mental health platform
- **4.8 million** people reached through Nafsak
- **270** people led at UNICEF climate campaign
- **2** nuclear research reactors visited (yes, really)
- **0.6%** of web content is Arabic (the problem I'm solving)
- **∞** lines of code that probably should have been debugged better

## Current Status: *Professional Code Wizard in Training*

**Location:** 🌁 San Francisco → 🗾 Tokyo → 🇰🇷 Seoul → 🌍 Wherever Minerva Sends Me Next

**Occupation:** Computer Science & Economics student at **Minerva University** | Serial builder of things | Professional "Let's just see what happens" enthusiast

### What I'm Building Right Now

1. **Howthink** - Because education shouldn't feel like medieval torture
   - *Featuring:* **Luca**, the AI tutor that refuses to give you answers (Socratic method, baby!)
   - *Status:* Serving 150+ students who somehow trust my code
   
2. **Awn AI** - The pivot that changed everything
   - *Started as:* Marketing analytics platform with break-even calculators and competitor analysis
   - *Pivoted to:* Arabic AI training data company (because only **0.6% of web content is Arabic**)
   - *The Vision:* Becoming the **"Turing for Arabic"** - specialized AI data infrastructure for frontier labs
   - *The Problem:* OpenAI, Anthropic, Google are **desperately hiring** Arabic annotators but no specialized platform exists
   - *The Market:* $108M by 2032, and we're racing to capture it
   
3. **SoilGuard** - Saving farms with *satellite data and AI agents*
   - Built in 16 hours during a Tokyo hackathon
   - Uses Google Earth Engine because regular Earth wasn't enough

## The Plot Twist Collection

### Chapter 1: *The Nuclear Phase* 
Studied **nuclear engineering** in high school because normal teenagers weren't interesting enough. Spent quality time with research reactors while my friends were on TikTok. Built a **HazGuard robotic arm** for remote operation in nuclear power plants using Arduino C and custom sensors. Yes, really.

### Chapter 2: *The Mental Health Revolution*
Created **Nafsak** during COVID lockdown depression. Hosted the Middle East's **first mental health summit** ("Mint Your Mental Health") with 1,500+ attendees. Egypt's biggest magazines couldn't stop writing about us. Reached 4.8M people and increased mental health literacy by 36%. Then I moved to SF and shut it down like a boss. 🎤⬇️

### Chapter 3: *The Current Quest*
Building AI tutors that **grill students** instead of spoon-feeding them. Currently perfecting the art of:
- Making AI remember things (agentic memory is *chef's kiss*)
- Teaching computers to teach humans  
- Solving Arabic AI data scarcity (only **0.6%** of web is Arabic!)
- Breaking prod at 3 AM (unintentionally, mostly)

## The Awn AI Story (A Masterclass in Pivoting)

**Act 1:** Built marketing analytics platform
- Break-even calculators, pricing strategies, competitor ad analysis
- Dynamic performance visualizations from Meta Ad Library
- Thought: "Marketing teams need better financial tools!"

**Act 2:** Research rabbit hole
- Discovered frontier labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) **desperately need Arabic training data**
- Found out: Arabic is only **0.6% of web content** vs 52.1% English
- Realized: **No specialized platform exists** for Arabic AI data (unlike Turing/Scale AI for English)

**Act 3:** The Pivot
- Awn AI transforms into **Arabic AI training data company**
- Target: Become infrastructure provider for GCC sovereign AI projects + frontier labs
- Vision: RL environments, model optimization, continuous training for Arabic AI
- Market: $108M Arabic AI data market by 2032

**The Opportunity:**
- Cohere hiring Arabic annotators at $30/hour (we can do better)
- HUMAIN (Saudi), G42 (UAE) need specialized Arabic datasets
- No competition doing platform approach for Arabic specifically
- Position: Silicon Valley execution + GCC cultural intelligence

## Skills & Superpowers

**Languages I Speak:**
- Python (fluently)
- JavaScript (with accent)
- Arabic (natively - the competitive advantage!)
- English (obviously)
- Git commit messages (still learning)

**Things I've Built With:**
- 🤖 FastAPI, React, Next.js
- 🧠 TensorFlow, PyTorch, RAG, Vector Embeddings
- ☁️ AWS, Docker, Supabase
- 🎨 tldraw (for that sweet whiteboard integration)
- 🌍 Google Earth Engine (for satellite data analysis)
- ☕ Coffee and determination

**Things I've Pivoted:**
- 📱 Marketing platform → AI infrastructure company
- 💰 Because market research > ego attachment

## Philosophy & Random Thoughts

> *"The best code is code you don't write."* - Eric Ries (but I believe it)

> *"Only 0.6% of web content is Arabic. That's not just a statistic—it's a market opportunity."* - Me, discovering my next pivot

**Core Beliefs:**
1. Build fast, learn faster, **pivot when data tells you to**
2. Mental health > everything
3. AI should *augment*, not replace
4. Market gaps are gifts (Arabic AI data scarcity = opportunity)
5. Good variable names are a love language
6. Comments are for future you (who will hate past you)

**Current Obsession:** Building Arabic AI infrastructure that doesn't suck

## Fun Facts That Nobody Asked For

- Started as a **graphic designer** at 14 (freelancing for Egyptian e-commerce)
- Went **viral on Instagram** at 16 with raw, unpolished content (thousands of likes)
- Managed **5M+ people climate campaign** at UNICEF while still in school
- Built a **robotic arm for nuclear plants** in high school because why not
- Created **region's first mental health summit** at 17 during COVID lockdown
- Now pivoting **marketing analytics → Arabic AI infrastructure** after discovering 0.6% statistic
- Somehow convinced people to let me teach their kids with experimental AI
- Can code in 3 languages, speak 2 languages, debug in all of them

---

### The TL;DR

*Egyptian kid who failed at YouTube → Nuclear engineering student → Mental health advocate → AI education builder → Arabic AI infrastructure founder → Currently debugging life one commit (and pivot) at a time*

**Current Mission:** Making Arabic AI not suck while teaching machines to teach humans

**Secret Weapon:** Willing to pivot when data says so (RIP original Awn AI, long live Awn AI 2.0)

**Status:** Building the future of education AND Arabic AI simultaneously because sleep is overrated 🚀
