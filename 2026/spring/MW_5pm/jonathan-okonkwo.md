# Jonathan Okonkwo: A Whimsical Snapshot

> "I love fashion, music, and coding. Do you have swag?"

**Hi! I'm Jonathan**, a junior at *Minerva University* studying **Computer Science**, and this term I'm taking **CS162 Software Development: Building Powerful Applications**.

## Quick Facts

- **Height:** 5'7" *(5'8" on a good day)*  
- **Major:** Computer Science  
- **Current Quest:** CS162 Software Development: Building Powerful Applications  

## Origin Story

I fell in love with coding when my brother introduced me to **frontend** during high school, and I've been tinkering with software ever since. Somewhere between *pixels and problem sets*, I realized building things is my favorite kind of magic.

## What I Love

1. **Music** — I love it, I make it, I live it.  
2. **Code** — I write it, I debug it, I celebrate it.  
3. **Curiosity** — the spark that keeps the lights on.  

## A Few Fun Notes

* I believe every line of code is a tiny story.
* My playlists are as eclectic as my side projects.
* I aspire to build apps that feel like a warm, well-timed drumbeat.

### Closing Thought
