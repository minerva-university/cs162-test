# 👋 Hello, I'm Tam!

Welcome! I’m someone who genuinely enjoys **working with people around the world** and finding ways to **make a real impact**-whether that’s through collaboration, communication, or building things that matter.

## About Me

I'm a junior at [Minerva University](https://www.minerva.edu/) majoring in Computational Sciences. I love building softwares and learning about new technological trends! 

## 💼 A Short Professional Adventure Log

* **Last summer:** I worked at **Rakuna**, where I gained hands-on experience and learned what it really means to operate in a fast-moving, people-centered environment.
* **Before that:** I explored **AI agent** in **networking**, diving into how intelligent systems communicate, coordinate, and scale.

Each step added a new lens to how I think about teamwork, technology, and impact.

## ✨ What Drives Me

* People, collaboration, and impact!
