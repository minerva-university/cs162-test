# Elijah Umana

## A Brief (and Whimsical) Biography

Elijah Umana is a computer science enthusiast who spends most of their time:

- Debugging code at 2 AM ☕
- Contemplating why they chose computer science
- Wondering if Stack Overflow has the answer (spoiler: it usually does)
- Refactoring code they wrote last week

### The Legend Begins

Once upon a time, in a land far far away (or maybe just on their laptop), **Elijah decided to join the world of programming**. This was either the *best* decision or the *worst* decision ever made. Only time will tell. 🎲

> *"Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!"* — Elijah, probably

### Skills (According to Elijah)

- **Python**: Moderately confident 🐍
- **JavaScript**: Absolutely terrified 😱
- **Debugging**: Expert level (because most time is spent here)
- **Procrastination**: *Master of the craft* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Fun Facts

1. Elijah has deleted code that took 3 hours to write in 0.5 seconds
2. They have written comments like `// TODO: fix this later` and never came back
3. They ***truly believe*** that "it works on my machine" is a valid response to bug reports
4. They have more browser tabs open than files in their project

### Hobbies

When not wrestling with syntax errors, Elijah enjoys:

- Reading about software architecture (then immediately forgetting it)
- Watching tutorial videos without coding along
- Creating elaborate project folder structures but abandoning them
- Celebrating when their code compiles on the first try (very rare)
