\## \*\*A little bit about me\*\*

I was born in Vietnam, where my love for computers goes deep into knowing whether a x64 or x32 version of a game will be compatible for my old laptop. I actually don't know what is happening with my life, so I retract to Dropout's Game Changer to see how the host of the show \*psychologically tortures\* the contestants in a wholesome way. In some sense, the same host also got retribution. My side hobby is creating new SAT questions to torture my students. Not really saying that I am unethical: if they need those to get a high score, it is more like they torture themselves. But I have a tingling sense that they will also \*\*\*seek vengeance\*\*\* for all of the questions I made them do on a daily basis.  



\## \*\*My skillsets\*\*

* Cooking: I won Minerva's Vegan MasterChef in Argentina. I don't cook vegan food on a daily basis. Please spare me. 
* Creating self-deprecating humor: That is just my life generally. 
* Doing non-CS things: It is insane how I take CS as one of my majors. One more day doing CS means I am getting closer to throwing everything away and start a farm. 
* Playing games: I am really good at Geometry Dash. If you are currently in Hyderabad, we should meet and compete! (although I don't really know what category we are competing for)



\## \*\*My favorite distractions\*\*

1. Helping my friends with whatever I can help with. I am not responsible for doing other people's work, by the way. 

2\. Telling NotebookLM to summarize an SS reading \*so that I wouldn't have to \*\*read so much\*\*. 

3\. Speed-running work-study so that I have time to apply for everything else.

\# My priorities

\[x] Getting a lot of work done for my work-study so that I can fully claim my money every 2 weeks

\[x] Falling in love with CS162 before falling out of love again simply because of software engineering

\[ ] Avoid conflict when I work with my team in CS162

\[ ] Conduct experiments for the first CS162 assignment and fail miserably
