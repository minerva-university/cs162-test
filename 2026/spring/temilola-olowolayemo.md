## Short Bio

Hi! I’m **Temilola**, a computer science student who enjoys building things, breaking them, and then figuring out why they broke. I’m interested in software systems, data, and how small design choices scale into big consequences.

> I like my code readable, my bugs reproducible, and my learning continuous.

## Things I Enjoy

- Learning new technical frameworks  
- Asking “why” until something actually makes sense  
- Turning vague ideas into concrete systems

## Fun Facts

- I believe good abstractions are underrated  
- I enjoy both theory *and* practical implementation  
- I am powered by curiosity and well-timed coffee

## Current Focus

1. Becoming a stronger software engineer  
2. Learning how teams build reliable systems  
3. Getting better at explaining complex ideas simply
