## About me
I enjoy ideating new things, breaking existing and figuring out how to make them better.  
I’m most alive when there’s **uncertainty, speed, and chaos ** involved.

## What I’m into
- 🥊 Combat Sports (Boxing & MMA), and anything adrenaline-adjacent (fast driving, motorbiking, taking risks)
- 🚀 Entrepreneurship and starting new things  
- 🧠 Understanding how systems work (and how they fail)
- 🛠 Turning messy ideas into something cool

## Fun facts
- I like chaos more than comfort 
- I tend to do first, think later 
- I treat challenges as games (and I like to win, but i am not salty if I lose either)
