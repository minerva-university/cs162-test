# James Olaitan: The Chronicle

## Pilot

Hello, world! I'm **James Olaitan**, a *Junior* Computer Science student currently navigating the mystical realms of algorithms, data structures, and the occasional existential crisis caused by missing semicolons.

> "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs."

## The Origin Story

Once upon a time, in a land filled with textbooks and caffeine, a young adventurer discovered the **ancient art of coding**. Armed with nothing but a laptop and *questionable amounts of determination*, I embarked on my quest to become a software sorcerer.

## Things That Spark Joy

- **Debugging at 2 AM** — *said no one ever*, but here we are
- Writing elegant code that actually works on the *first* try (rare but magical)
- Learning new programming languages like they're Pokémon
- Pretending I understand recursion (to understand recursion, see this bullet point)

---

## Current Quests

1. **Survive CS162** — the epic saga continues
2. Master the dark arts of *distributed systems*
3. Build something **actually useful** before graduation
4. Find the legendary "work-life balance"

## Philosophical Musings

> "In a world of infinite loops, be the `break` statement."

I believe that:

- **Good code** is like good poetry — *concise*, meaningful, and slightly confusing to outsiders
- Every bug is just a feature *waiting for documentation*
- The best debugging tool is a **rubber duck** (yes, seriously)

## Fun Facts

- I can explain the difference between `==` and `===` with *dramatic flair*
- My code comments are occasionally funnier than my actual jokes
- I've *never* rage-quit a coding project ~~(this is a lie)~~

## Motto

***Build. Break. Debug. Repeat.***
