Hello! I'm **Ramsha Ali**, a passionate explorer of ideas and technology. My heart beats for **autonomous vehicles**, the future of mobility, and the magic of **reading** books that expand the mind. Whether it's diving into a book or debugging algorithms, I love immersing myself in challenges that make me think and grow.

## My Hobbies:
- ðŸ¤– **Autonomous Tech Enthusiast**: I spend hours imagining how self-driving cars will reshape our world and tinkering with ideas to make them smarter.  
- ðŸ¥Š **Boxing Buff**: Once, I got punched in the head so hard I lost hearing for a couple of minutes. I'm taking a break from it this semester.
- ðŸŽ» **Violin Virtuoso (in Progress)**: Whether itâ€™s Bach or just some screechy scales, the violin lets me channel creativity in a whole new way.

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™d like to chat about self-driving cars, books, or the best way to dodge a punch!
