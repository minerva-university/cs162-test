## About Me
- **Student** at Minerva
- Loves *coding*, *driving*, *hikng* and *late-night debugging*
- Once accidentally ~~deleted~~ *improved* a whole project repo.

## Fun Facts
1. I can write Python faster than I can cook pasta 🍝.
2. I speak 3 languages (and Markdown counts as one).
3. My cat is probably smarter than me.
